Application r√©elle:
The HK government plans to hold a Super Light-and-Sound Show in the Victoria Harbor on New Year  eve. The organizing committee has asked the HKE power  company  about the maximum electric power that can be supplied at the WanChai Sub-Station for use in the  celebration  events.  The  power  generator  for  this  is  located  on  Lamma  Island.  It  will be  supplied  to  the  WanChai  station  for  utilization  for  the  event.  The following  figure shows the maximum available capacity (after subtracting other
 normal use requirements) for   transferring   power   between   different   sub-stations   on   HK   Island.   What   is   the 
maximum power that HKE can promise to the event organizer?
